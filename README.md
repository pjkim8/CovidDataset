# Vaccination Tracker Project

- Cleaned and extracted Covid Vaccine dataset in SQL Server
- Imported data into Tableau to create charts and map to display number of people fully vaccinated and total vaccinations based on country
- Created an interactive dashboard in Tableau that tracked the number of vaccinations in each country

## Data Cleaning
Most of the data was already clean so except for the date column so I converted it in SQL Server.
