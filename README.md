# Vaccination Tracker Project

- Cleaned and extracted data from Covid Vaccine dataset in SQL Server
- Imported data into Tableau to create charts and map to display number of people fully vaccinated and total vaccinations based on country
- Created an interactive dashboard in Tableau that tracked the number of vaccinations in each country

## Data Cleaning
Most of the data was already clean so except for the date column so I converted it in SQL Server.

## Data Extraction
I wrote queries in SQL Server to find out the total vaccinations and fully vaccinations numbers in each country. I then copied the data onto Excel to then be used for data visualizations in Tableau.

## Tableau Dashboard
I imported the Excel spreadsheets into Tableau and created graphs and charts tracking the number of people fully vaccinated and total vaccinations based on country. With the graphs I then made a interactive dashboard in Tableau.
